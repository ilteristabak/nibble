One of the most significant difficulty that we have faced was assigning a property
outside of a graph definition. We could not figured out how we could handle this so
we decided to remove that part.

Another difficulty we encountered was shift/reduce conflict. We were faced with 4 shift/reduce conflicts at definiton parser and 7 shift/reduce conflicts at query parser. We received help from instructor to handle the conflicts.

Last difficulty was about quotation mark. While writing sample programs, we used a text editor that creates curly quotation marks. However, we had used straight quotation marks. When we gave any sample code, that contains curly qoutation marks, to parsers, we got a syntax error. Finding the reason of this error took times. Finally, we changed all curly quotation marks to straight quotation marks.
