One of the most significant difficulty that we have faced was assigning a property
outside of a graph definition. We could not figured out how we could handle this so
we decided to remove that part.

Another difficulty was happened at the stage of writing the definition parser. After
we wrote the parser we were faced with 4 shift/reduce conflict. We could not solve
the property until asking to our instructor.
