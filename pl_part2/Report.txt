Project Report Part 2

One of the most significant difficulty that we have faced was assigning a property
outside of a graph definition. We could not figured out how we could handle this so
we decided to remove that part.

Another difficulty was happened at the stage of writing the definition parser. After
we wrote the parser we were faced with 4 shift/reduce conflict. Then we understood that
when we tried to define to graph at the same time, their IDs overlaped. So we changed 
our grammar to not define more than one graph.

Last difficulty was about quotation mark. While writing sample programs, we used a text 
editor that creates curly quotation marks. However, we had used straight quotation marks.
When we gave any sample code, that contains curly qoutation marks, to parsers, we got a 
syntax error. Finding the reason of this error took times. Finally, we changed all curly 
quotation marks to straight quotation marks.
